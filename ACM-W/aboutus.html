                    I was interested in joining ACM-W to bring representation and awareness to the nondevelopmental
                    aspects
                    of computing
                    in which women are still significantly underrepresented in. Through ACM-W events, I want to bridge
                    the
                    knowledge and
                    networking gap, to foster the crossover between the development and non development aspects of our
                    community. Upon
                    completing my schooling, I hope to pursue a career in software architecture and software ethics.

                    This goal aligns with my career ambitions in software engineering and reflects my
                    dedication to making a meaningful impact.

                    I am excited to join ACM-W to address the underrepresentation
                    of women in computing. My involvement in tech projects has enhanced my skills in collaborative
                    teamwork, which is crucial for fostering inclusivity in ACM-W. Outside
                    of academics, I enjoy traveling, engaging in outdoor activities,
                    photography, and spending quality time with family and friends.
                    Post-graduation, I plan to pursue a career in Business Analytics
                    or a related field. I am looking forward to meeting everyone in ACM-W!

                    I think its important to seek out and create spaces
                    for women and other underrepresented groups in computing,
                    a field lacking in diversity, which I hope to do at ACM-W.
                    I look forward to building an amazing community here! In
                    the future I hope to become a software developer.

                    I found there to be a lack of community around me for women in tech,
                    which is why I took it upon myself to join ACM-W's mission in creating a
                    supportive environment for women in computing around me. I believe that
                    uplifting one another as women is the ultimate roadmap to success! Where
                    does my roadmap take me? In 5 years, I hope to become a product manager!

                    I became interested in ACM-W because it helped reach more representation for women in computing careers,
                    creating opportunities to network and apply skills in computing to diversify the field. It's important
                    that in a constantly growing field, we have more representation, and I hope through ACM-W,
                    we can encourage that representation. In the future, I plan to become a UX Designer.

                    As I began to attend CS classes at UW I noticed a large gender imbalance in each of my classes.
                    Given the cs industryâ€™s skewed ratio, I hoped to connect with more women sharing similar career goals.
                    When I learned about ACM-W, I saw it as a chance to build connections with other women in the field
                    and support each other in our shared journey.
                    Upon schooling I hope to get involved with software security and help transform the online world
                    into a safer place for everyone.
